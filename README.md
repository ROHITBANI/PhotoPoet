This app uses the Google Gemini APIâ€™s multimodal capabilities to turn photos into poems, wrapped in a sleek Streamlit interface.
The default settings (e.g., temperature=0.7, max_output_tokens=150) produce concise, creative poems, but you can tweak them for different results. For example, increase temperature for more abstract poems or adjust max_output_tokens for longer ones.

### Enjoy generating poetic masterpieces from your photos!
